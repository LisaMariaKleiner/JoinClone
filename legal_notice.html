            </p></b>
        
            <p>Phone: <br />
             Email:</p>

             <p>The responsible party is the natural or legal person who, alone or jointly with others, decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).</p>
            <h3>Storage Period</h3>
            <p>Unless a specific storage period is specified within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you make a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.</p>
            <h3>General Information on Data Processing</h3>
            <p>If you have given your consent to data processing, we will process your personal data on the basis of Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR or Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR if special categories of data are processed in accordance with Article 9(1) of the GDPR. In case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also carried out on the basis of Article 49(1)(a) of the GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information on your device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing will also take place on the basis of § 25(1) of the German Telemedia Act (TMG). Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the fulfillment of a contract or for the performance of pre-contractual measures, we will process your data on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based on Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR. Data processing may also take place on the basis of our legitimate interests pursuant to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR. The relevant legal bases for data processing are explained in the following sections of this privacy policy.</p>
            <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
            <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent that has already been given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
            <h3>Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and Direct Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
            <p>If data processing is carried out on the basis of Article 6(1)(e) or (f) of the GDPR, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data for reasons that arise from your particular situation, including profiling based on these provisions. The respective legal basis on which processing is based can be found in this privacy policy. If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or the processing serves to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims (objection pursuant to Article 21(1) GDPR).</p>
            <p>If your personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for the purpose of such advertising, including profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. If you object, your personal data will subsequently no longer be used for the purpose of direct marketing (objection pursuant to Article 21(2) GDPR).

                <h3>Complaint to the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
                <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of their habitual residence, place of work, or place of the alleged infringement. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>
                <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
                <p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.</p>
                <h3>Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
                <p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient, and the purpose of data processing, as well as a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well as for further questions regarding personal data, you can contact us at any time.</p>
                <h3>Right to Restrict Processing</h3>
                <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time for this purpose. The right to restrict processing exists in the following cases:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the examination, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
                    <li>If the processing of your personal data is unlawful, but you do not want it to be deleted, you can request the restriction of the processing instead.</li>
                    <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
                    <li>If you have filed an objection pursuant to Article 21(1) GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data – apart from its storage – may only be processed with your consent or for the purpose of asserting, exercising, or defending legal claims or protecting the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a member state.</p>
                <h3>Objection to Promotional Emails</h3>
                <p>We hereby expressly prohibit the use of contact data published in the context of website legal notice requirements with regard to sending promotional and informational materials not expressly requested. The operators of this website expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited promotional information, such as spam emails.</p>
                <h2>3. Data Collection on this Website</h2>
                <h3>Server Log Files</h3>
                <p>The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Browser type and browser version</li>
                    <li>Operating system used</li>
                    <li>Referrer URL</li>
                    <li>Host name of the accessing computer</li>
                    <li>Time of the server request</li>
                    <li>IP address</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These data will not be combined with data from other sources.</p>
                <p>The collection of this data is based on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the technically error-free presentation and optimization of their website – for this purpose, server log files must be collected.</p>
